# KBase SDK Actions
GitHub Actions CI workflows for apps built with the [KBase SDK](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/index.html) 

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a [KBase developer token](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/tutorial/3_initialize.html#set-up-your-developer-credentials) saved as `KBASE_TEST_TOKEN` in your repo or org's [GitHub Secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) settings.
2. Copy the [action.yaml](./action.yaml) file to your project's `.github/workflows/` directory.
```bash
# Skip if directory already exists
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Add workflow file
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsfillman/kb_sdk_actions/master/action.yaml  --output .github/workflows/kb_sdk_test.yaml
```
3. Commit the new workflow to your repo.
```bash
git add .github/workflows/kb_sdk_test.yaml
git commit -m "Adding Actions workflow for KB SDK tests."
git push 
# Push to the branch of your pull request, or push to master if preferred.
git push -u origin master
4. You're done! Any future commits and pull requests to your repo's `master` branch will trigger the SDK tests to run.

To review your projet's SDK test status and results, see your repo's [Actions tab](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/managing-a-workflow-run#about-workflow-management).
